# Google Homepage Clone

This project is a clone of the Google homepage, built using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to recreate the appearance of the Google homepage using only HTML and CSS.

## Techniques Used

### Reset CSS
A CSS reset is applied to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers by removing default styling provided by browsers.

### Variables
Custom properties (CSS variables) are utilized to define reusable values such as colors and fonts, enhancing maintainability and ease of styling.

### Flexbox Layout
Flexbox is employed for creating responsive and flexible layouts, enabling easy alignment and distribution of elements within containers.

### Media Queries
Media queries are used to apply different styles based on the screen size, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to various devices.

### Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes
The pseudo-element `::after` are utilized for adding captions dynamically. Pseudo-classes like `:hover` are used for interactive elements, providing visual feedback to users.

## CSS Structure
The CSS is organized into sections corresponding to different parts of the Google homepage:

- **Global**: Defines global styles for the body and anchor elements.
- **Header/Menu**: Styles for the header section containing the menu and icons.
- **Bottom caption**: Styles for the captions displayed on icons hover.
- **Main**: Styles for the main content area, including the logo and search bar.
- **Search Area**: Styles for the search bar and its components.
- **Buttons**: Styles for the search buttons.
- **Footer**: Styles for the footer section, including country information and links.

## Desktop Version
Specific styles are applied for screens with a minimum width of 450px to optimize the layout for larger screens. Adjustments include spacing, font sizes, and container widths.
